# sqlcmd (mssql-tools) API
A .net 7 CA design web API for sqlcmd - useful for linux, web SQL needs and db utility apps. It requires a SQL server/container and sqlcmd installed. SQL server does not have to be on the same machine.

I need to more around the security and add a lot of features but it's a start.

Feel free to contribute or make suggestions.
